## Introduction to TTD

## Repository navigation

This repository contains multiple Katas. In order to keep everything organised each kata has it's own folder within the main katas folder. Inside each specific kata file you will find the functionality for the challenge in one file and the tests for that functionality in a separate file. All instructions and kata details are contained here within this readme file.
